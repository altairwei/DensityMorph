\title{Paired density logratio}
\usage{
PDLR(X1, X2, K = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{A matrix of points, with each row corresponding to a point's
coordinates in a multi-dimensional real space.}

\item{X2}{A second matrix of points, to be compared to X1. The number of
columns and rows must be equal to those of X1.}

\item{K}{The number of the first K nearest neighbours (NN) to average over,
defaults to K = 1}
}
\value{
A set of real numbers corresponding to the log-10 ratio of the cross
NN distances to the self NN distances
}
\description{
Calculates the paired density logratio (PDLR) between two multi-dimensional
sets of points
