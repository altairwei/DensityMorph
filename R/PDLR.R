#' Calculates the paired density logratio (PDLR) between two multi-dimensional
#' sets of points
#'
#' @title Paired density logratio
#'
#' @param X1 A matrix of points, with each row corresponding to a point's
#' coordinates in a multi-dimensional real space.
#' @param X2 A second matrix of points, to be compared to X1. The number of
#' columns and rows must be equal to those of X1.
#' @param K The number of the first K nearest neighbours (NN) to average over,
#' defaults to K = 1
#'
#' @return A set of real numbers corresponding to the log-10 ratio of the cross
#' NN distances to the self NN distances
